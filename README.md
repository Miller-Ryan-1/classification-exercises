### Actual Machine Learning Taking Place Here!

Well, at least the models behind them for Classifying Data.  Learned about **sklearn**, and first built the functions to acquire, prep/clean, and split the data before peforming bi- and multivariate exploratory data analysis.  Then learned how to interperet and compare results to baseline.

Models applied:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
